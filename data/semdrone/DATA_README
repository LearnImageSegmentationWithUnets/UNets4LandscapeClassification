The dataset is available at https://www.tugraz.at/index.php?id=22387 and consists of 400 images
and associated binary masks of 23 categories.

The imagery depicts houses from nadir view acquired at an altitude of 5 to 30 meters above ground.

A high resolution camera was used to acquire images at a size of 6000 x 4000 px (24 Mpx).

The classes are:
* unlabeled
* paved-area
* dirt
* grass
* gravel
* water
* rocks
* pool
* vegetation
* roof
* wall
* window
* door
* fence
* fence-pole
* person
* dog
* car
* bicycle
* tree
* bald-tree
* ar-marker
* obstacle
* conflicting

For speed, we will be working with a random subset of these data (100 images and associated masks),
but the same workflow would be appropriate for the entire dataset.
